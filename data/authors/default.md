Hey there! 👋🏻

My name is Valentina and I am a passionate **Front-end Software Engineer** with a knack for [Design Systems](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/defining-design-systems-6dd4b03e0ff6) and a special interest in [UCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) & a11y best-practices.

I genuinely enjoy thinking about Usability, and love to make great Designs come to life through `<code />`.

In my spare time I enjoy playing the drums <span role="img" aria-label="drums-emoji">🥁</span>, reading books about personal finance & self-improvement <span role="img" aria-label="books-emoji">📚</span>, and expanding my knowledge about cryptocurrencies <span role="img" aria-label="books-emoji">💱</span>.

Feel free to get a copy of my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWQfwZdzvKgJEWsxtYdsTVaXvOQ8YwqN/view?usp=sharing) if you wanna learn something more about my background and experience.
