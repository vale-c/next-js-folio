Hey there! 👋🏻

My name is Valentina and I am a passionate **Front-end Software Engineer** with a knack for [Design Systems](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/defining-design-systems-6dd4b03e0ff6) and a special interest in [UCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) & a11y best-practices.

I genuinely enjoy thinking about Usability, and love to make great Designs come to life through `<code />`.
