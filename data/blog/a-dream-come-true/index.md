I still can't believe what I am about to write, because if they had told me about it a couple of years ago I would have most certainly laughed in disbelief.

So here we go.

A lifetime dream. The perfect fairytale. My most common daydreaming scenario.

I am going to New York City. For real.

I've landed an internship as a Front-End Developer at Adobe,Â and I will be working with the Behance team to contribute in the creation and delivery of beautiful and highly usable interactions in their products.

It's going to be a full-time internship from mid June till the end of August for a total of 12 weeks.

NYC has always been my dream city: ever since I was a little girl I used to virtually wander around the streets of New York using Google Maps, and hoping to one day be able to go there and experience what it feels like.

Being able to spend 3 months in NYC feels unreal: it's the fulfilment not only of a lifetime goal, but a professional achievement since during these past few years I worked hard to gain knowledge and expertise in Web Development.
