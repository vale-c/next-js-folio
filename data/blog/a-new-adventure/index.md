Hey there,

if you're reading this, well I'm glad you landed on this page and I hope you're gonna enjoy the content ahead üòä.

I haven't updated my blog in a while but felt it was the right time to publish a new post, because there is some great upcoming news in the air...

I still can't believe this is happening to me but recently I was accepted for another amazing internship program in Atlanta (GA), where I'm gonna work for the whole summer as a UX Engineer Intern with a wonderful Tech company whose mission is to empower small businesses so to make them grow and thrive in the most effective ways!

It's a 12 weeks program, and my main tasks are gonna involve the collaboration¬†with the Design System with the aim to improve internal tooling for the Design team, and to help define new patterns for the application. I am gonna work directly with a team of engineers and designers to gain real-world experience as an engineer.

It's gonna be such an exciting and wonderful opportunity for me to gain real experience as a UX Engineer, and to cooperate with brilliant people towards the realisation of a product whose main goal is to improve other people's lives through their personal business vision.

Wish me luck! üçÄ
