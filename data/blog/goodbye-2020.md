![2020](/static/images/blog-posts/goodbye-2020.jpg)

**2020**, what a year.

I won't digress nor try to capture with vague and ephemeral words the global scenario that has turned so many lives upside down during these past 12 months, because it's been so intense and dramatic in many ways and enough words have already been spent on this.

I will just say that I truly hope that as many people as possible will be able to finally turn the page and to move on with a positive start of 2021.

This year has been incredibly intense for me too.

I **graduated in March** when the pandemic was hitting hard, and it was such a surreal experience to spend my graduation day at home in front of a webcam instead of celebrating it with my friends, but nonetheless I am happy that I was able to achieve this great goal of mine.

Soon after graduating I started my first official full-time job as a **Front-end Software Engineer** at Cloud Academy, and I gotta say it's helping me a lot to become a much better Software Developer.

Being able to actively contribute to a **Design System** using the latest tools & frameworks is definitely a great chance for me to think about the product from the ground-up, and collaborating with Designers to establish visual patterns & rules is rewarding and interesting.

Also, I was officially accepted as a grad student for a **M.S. in Computer Science** at **Georgia Tech** and I will be starting in a week from now!

This is so exciting for me, but I hope I can find a good work/life balance because it's gonna be pretty tough to combine two challenges of this magnitude.

I will also try to keep this blog more up-to-date, and my mission is also going to be to write a few technical blog posts on front-end related topics as well (or maybe som ML stuff?!).

Anyway, if you've read this far thank you my dear virtual friend and stay tuned for more!

**2021 here we go!**
