## 12 incredible Weeks as a UX Designer Intern

There would be _so_ many things and anecdotes to talk about which contributed to making my internship experience at **Mailchimp** truly unique.

And a simple blog post cannot capture all the magic concentrated in the span of **12 weeks**, so I am just going to highlight a few key aspects that made this summer absolutely unforgettable.

Working with the Design System team as a **UX Engineer** has been such an exciting part of my journey to Atlanta, and it made me understand about how important it is to have a great sense of team work and cooperation when starting to conceptualise the building blocks of a whole new Design System.

As a matter of fact, having a clear sense of **direction** and a **vision** is not enough, as the mission of a **Design System** team is to standardise and make the visual elements of a User Experience fully accessible, well-documented and completely in-line with the company vision and strategy.

It is no easy task, believe me.

But thatâ€™s part and parcel of the fun of it.

Using the latest technologies and frameworks to bring to life the **User Interface** of a product is such a great and **empowering** feeling, and being able to actively contribute to the various discussions with the team and receiving feedback along the way, makes the whole process so much smoother and enjoyable.

I feel so **lucky** to have had this opportunity to work with such **talented people**, and every day felt like a whole new chapter to continue **being inspired** and motivated to see things grow and change.
