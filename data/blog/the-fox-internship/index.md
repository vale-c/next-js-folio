I'm gonna be working with The Fox Magazine as an Editorial Intern!

The Fox Magazine is a premier lifestyle publication focusing on beginnings, creativity, and risk.
Since March of 2016, The Fox Magazine explores an original, vivid, and timeless insight into the essence of photography, travel, food, fashion, music, and technology.
The mission is to be the leading resource of inspiration for individuals wanting to chase their dreams and seek a fulfilling lifestyle.

It' gonna be such a great opportunity for me to challenge myself into pursuing something different from what I am normally used to doing (i.e. Front-End Web Development), and I am truly looking forward to cooperating with journalists, scholars, photographers, musicians, travellers, chefs, and even fashion designers to bring the Fox Magazine's mission to life!
